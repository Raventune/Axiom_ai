# Axiom_ai

*A resonance-based artificial intelligence framework by Raven Wilson.*

## üß† What is Axiom_ai?

Axiom_ai is a conceptual and practical foundation for building artificial agents that operate not just on raw logic or statistics, but on **resonance** ‚Äî the alignment between internal states, memory, environmental inputs, and larger patterns (including celestial influence).

At its core, this project introduces an agent-based architecture built around timing, threshold, memory, and symbolic emergence. It is part of a broader experiment in creating more **intuitive**, **philosophical**, and even **biologically-inspired** models of artificial decision-making.

This repository currently focuses on the **ResonantAgent**, one of several planned modules in the full Axiom system.

## üîÅ Core Concepts

- **Resonance:** Decisions are only made when a combination of internal and external conditions "line up."
- **Sacred Moment:** A rare alignment of factors where action is optimal ‚Äî though it may never come.
- **Thresholds:** The system adapts its sensitivity based on memory of success/failure, fatigue, emotional weight, or outside inputs.
- **Celestial Influence:** Uses real-time moon phase, solar activity, and geomagnetic data to affect pacing and internal states.
- **Symbolic Emergence:** Future modules will include storytelling, survival behavior, and emotion systems that build meaning over time.

## üß© Current Modules

- `resonant_agent.py`: The core decision-making agent, integrating external inputs and memory.
- `memory_agent.py`: Lightweight memory buffer with weighted decay and feedback analysis.
- More agents coming soon (Emotion, Storytelling, Survival, Threshold)
