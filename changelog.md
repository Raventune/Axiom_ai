Added

    Integrated EmotionAgent with the core system to maintain a quantum-inspired emotional state influenced by resonance scores and sacred moments.

    Added ResonantAgent integration inside AxiomDispatcher to generate resonance scores influencing the emotional state.

    Extended ChatAgent.chat() method to accept an optional context parameter, allowing the injection of emotion context directly into the prompt.

    Updated build_prompt() in ChatAgent to append emotional context to the prompt dynamically.

    Implemented emotional state persistence and decay logic within EmotionAgent to provide consistent emotional tagging over time.

    Stored emotion metadata alongside dialogue in MemoryAgent to enable long-term emotional context tracking.

Changed

    Modified AxiomDispatcher.chat() to:

        Run a resonance cycle via ResonantAgent.

        Update emotional state using the resonance score.

        Pass the current emotional context as part of the prompt when generating AI chat responses.

        Log emotion state and resonance metadata in memory for contextual awareness and future recall.
